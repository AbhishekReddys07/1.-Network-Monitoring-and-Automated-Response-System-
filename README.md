# Network Monitoring and Automated Response System

This project implements a robust network monitoring and automated response system using Python. The system continuously monitors network activity, detects potential issues or anomalies, and triggers predefined actions based on specific events.

**Key Features:**

* Real-time network monitoring
* Automated response mechanisms (e.g., alerts, service restarts)
* Log file analysis for troubleshooting
* Client-server architecture for efficient communication
* Cross-platform compatibility

**Technologies Used:**

* Python
* Socket Programming
* Multithreading
* File Handling
* System Interaction

**How to Run:**

1. **Install required libraries:** 
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2.**Configure the server:**
   Modify the server.py script with appropriate server settings (host, port).
   Configure the log file paths and search strings as needed.
3.**Run the server:**
   Bash
   python server.py
4.**Run the client:**
Modify the client.java templeate with the IP addresses of the servers to monitor.
Run the client.java templeate.

Note: This is a simplified example. For production environments, consider implementing more robust error handling, logging, and security measures.
