Note: not all the logic and additional functions are not integrated with the server.py and Client.py, basically it's a baseline code, please check the below content to get an idea/Overview.

How It Works: 

1. File Handling:
The function opens and reads a specified log file. This could be a text file where log entries are recorded or in progress.
if the equivalent string is found the timer script will start in a new thread and check the logs every three hours until 3 days.  

2.Log File Parsing:

It iterates through the log file line by line, looking for specific patterns or keywords that indicate whether the timer script should run.
This might involve searching for error messages, timestamps, or specific event markers that trigger the timer or stop.

3. Condition Checking:

The function checks each line against predefined conditions. If a line matches the criteria (e.g., an error code, a specific event, or a threshold being exceeded), the function sets a flag or triggers an action.
If the conditions are met, the function prepares to initiate the timer script.

4. Decision Making:

Based on the log file analysis, the function decides whether to execute the timer script. This decision could be as simple as returning a boolean value (True for run, False for don't run)or involve more complex logic to determine the script's parameters.

5. Executing the Timer Script:

If the conditions for running the timer script are satisfied, the function initiates the timer script. This could be done by calling another function, executing a shell command, or triggering a timer event in the application.
